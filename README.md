# Furor Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind)

This is a frontend-only clone of a fashion e-commerce site (Furor-style). It uses local JSON for product data and `localStorage` for cart persistence.

## Setup

1. Ensure Node.js (>=16) is installed.
2. Run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Open `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default).

## Notes

- Replace images in `public/images/` with your real product images.
- This project is frontend-only. Checkout and payments are placeholders.
